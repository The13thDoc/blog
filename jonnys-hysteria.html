	<h3>About Jonny</h3>

	<p>I'm Jonny. I like to write. Sometimes I write code, sometimes
		music, sometimes lyrics. Other times, I simply jot down insane and
		incoherent thoughts. This is where I spew thoughts of advice,
		wisdom, rage, and/or insanity. Read some. They may be
		inspirational....or encourage thoughts of homicide and a disgust
		towards humanity.</p>

		<h2>WARNING</h2>
		<p>These writings may be brash, terse, or very profane. These are published at my discretion and read at yours.</p>
		<a href={{ site.baseurl }}/writings.html>Back to writings...</a>
