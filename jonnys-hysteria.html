	<h3>About Jonny</h3>
	
	<p>I'm Jon. I like to write. Sometimes I write code, sometimes
		music, sometimes lyrics. Other times, I simply jot down insane and
		incoherent thoughts. This is where I spew thoughts of advice,
		wisdom, rage, and/or insanity. Read some. They may be
		inspirational....or encourage thoughts of homicide and a disgust
		towards humanity.</p>
