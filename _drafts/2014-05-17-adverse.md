I had something to say. What was a man to do, let everything continue to come unglued?
The world is a dreary place. We do what we can, but there are those among us with a grander plan.
So they say. Who’s to know? Their God has for us a goal. They’re blessed, righteous, exempt from sin, whereas the rest of us are cowards bred not of his kin. What are we? Can you see? Do you know? Do you control?
Careful now, the weak are rising. Read your tome. You know our role!

So, I ask you...

Hey, you son of a bitch! What kind of a world are we living with?!
Your leeches say you’re watching over us! From here it sure looks like you don’t give two fucks!
They reign. They rule. They offer us a wonderful life that they claim is just. If they are you, and you are them, my patience is volatile and wearing thin!

God...
Where is God?

God...
I want to scream...at...God.

I’m just a little bit pissed and just a little concerned that my words are being taken as far-fetched and absurd. Sure, I could pray. I could sit quietly and wait, but years of that have left me hollow and numb.
I want to walk up to the gate. I want to scream in his face. I want him to hear all my fucking hate. Cast me. Damn me. Negate my existence. Come on you fucker, give me your strongest resistance. Marching and storming without a single soul; so I can scream in your ear, these condemning words!

So, I ask you...

Hey, you son of a bitch! What kind of a world are we living with?!
Your leeches say you’re watching over us! From here it sure looks like you don’t give two fucks!
They reign. They rule. They offer us a wonderful life that they claim is just. If they are you, and you are them, my patience is volatile and wearing thin!

So, I ask you again, God of mine, as I suffer in sin. Your ego fuck is of my own accord. I'm shoving us down to lay upon this sword. I see now not the error of my ways. From your image, projected, I have been made. So let us fail and let us fall, until you, myself, shall right each of these wrongs.
