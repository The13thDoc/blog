**Subject: My Day Just Got Worse**
**Date: 5/6/2014**

He just talked to me.

He has been striving to visit her numerous times, while a restraining order is in effect until December 22nd 2014.

How _fucking_ absurd is that? __Don't you dare mention this to her, Rose, David, or Margaret.__

I can't believe that people go to such great lengths to do things after given such _great_ reason to abandon them.

I felt bullied by you this morning. I apologize that I can't progress forward any more quickly than I am, but I am doing my best each day to continue while contacting employers and finding a _correct fit_ of a job, and _trying_ to keep healthy with food stamps that _my tax money_ paid for over the last few years.

...and I'm criticized for having a bottle of alcohol.

If you are having struggles and feeling upset, I completely understand that and empathize with you. If you _really_ feel against me being in this household, then kick me out. I will live on the street and try to find a job. It's not as if it hasn't been attempted. Honest relationships...some things just fail. Dreams _may_ come true, but some of us are stuck with nightmares.

I have tried for 26 years. This wannabe democracy, shameful and pitiful attempt at living a Christian, godly lifestyle, running a country in such a fashion and calling it patriotic is the biggest form of retardation and stupidity I've ever seen. This is why I don't believe in God. All of you have successfully convinced me that it is a wrong thing to do.

I can have respect. I really can, but I've been stretched too far. I encourage you to find a reason why I should not end this waste of a life in an attempt to meet _your_ god.

Oh-so-sincerely yours,

    - Hyde
