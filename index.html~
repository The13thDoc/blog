			A Harsh Start
			</h2>

			<p>
			Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr...so many places to spew fourth one's stupidity and indulge one's narcissism. 
			</p>
			<p>
			In a time when things are so customizeable, they are, still, so restricting. I begin this as many developers, old-school engineers, and anyone else utlizing HTML for communication do, creating my own space to say, "Hello, World." and doing it from scratch...from code, anyway.
</p>
<p>
I began this harshly, with a vague plan as to how to construct a blog appropriately. I'm not especially proud of that, but it's a work in progress from this point on. Caffeine, stress, and the need to focus thoughts on something more productive. Heh.

			<h1>About</h1>
			I'm Jon. I like to write. Sometimes I write code, sometimes music, sometimes lyrics. Other times, I simply jot down insane and incoherent thoughts. Read some. They may be inspirational....or encourage thoughts of homicide and a disgust towards humanity.
