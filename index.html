					<h2>A Harsh Start</h2>
					</p>
					<p>Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr...so many places to spew fourth
						one's stupidity and indulge one's narcissism.</p>
					<p>In a time when things are so customizeable, they are, still,
						so restricting. I begin this as many developers, old-school
						engineers, and anyone else utlizing HTML for communication do,
						creating my own space to say, "Hello, World." and doing it from
						scratch...from code, anyway.
					<p>I began this harshly, with a vague plan as to how to
						construct a blog appropriately. I'm not especially proud of that,
						but it's a work in progress from this point on. Caffeine, stress,
						and the need to focus thoughts on something more productive. Heh.</p>

					<div id='about-jonny'>
						<p></p><h1>About Jonny</h1></p>
						<p></p>I'm Jon. I like to write. Sometimes I write code, sometimes music,
						sometimes lyrics. Other times, I simply jot down insane and
						incoherent thoughts. This is where I spew thoughts of advice,
						wisdom, rage, and/or insanity. Read some. They may be
						inspirational....or encourage thoughts of homicide and a disgust
						towards humanity.</p>
