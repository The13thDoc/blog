					resounding between, among, and around axons and neurons....only to

<h2>A Harsh Start</h2>
<p>Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr...so many places to spew fourth one's stupidity and indulge one's narcissism.</p>


<p>In a time when things are so customizable, they are, still, so restricting. I begin this as many developers, old-school engineers, and anyone else utilizing HTML for communication do, creating my own space to say, "Hello, World." and doing it from scratch...from code, anyway.</p>

<p>I began this harshly, with a vague plan as to how to construct a Blog appropriately. I'm not especially proud of that, but it's a work in progress from this point on. Caffeine, stress, and the need to focus thoughts on something more productive. Heh.</p>

						<h1>About Jonny</h1>
						</p>
						<p>I'm Jon. I like to write. Sometimes I write code, sometimes
							music, sometimes lyrics. Other times, I simply jot down insane
							and incoherent thoughts. This is where I spew thoughts of advice,
							wisdom, rage, and/or insanity. Read some. They may be
							inspirational....or encourage thoughts of homicide and a disgust
							towards humanity.</p>
