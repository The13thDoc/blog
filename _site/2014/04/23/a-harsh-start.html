<h2 id="a-harsh-start">A Harsh Start</h2>

<p>Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr…so many places to spew fourth one’s stupidity and indulge one’s narcissism.</p>

<p>In a time when things are so customizable, they are, still, so restricting. I begin this as many developers, old-school engineers, and anyone else utilizing HTML for communication do, creating my own space to say, “Hello, World.” and doing it from scratch…from code, anyway.</p>

<p>I began this harshly, with a vague plan as to how to construct a Blog appropriately. I’m not especially proud of that, but it’s a work in progress from this point on. Caffeine, stress, and the need to focus thoughts on something more productive. Heh.</p>
