<h2>Subject: My Day Just Got Worse</h2>

<p>My dad just talked to me.</p>

<p>He has been striving to visit April numerous times, while a restraining order is in effect until December 22nd 2014. </p>

<p>How <strong>fucking</strong> absurd is that? <em>Don&#39;t you dare mention this to April, Ruth, Dean, or Margaret.</em></p>

<p>I can&#39;t believe that people go to such great lengths to do things after given such <em>great</em> reason to abandon the, or change their ways.</p>

<p>I felt bullied by you this morning. I apologize that I can&#39;t progress forward any more quickly than I am, but I am doing my best each day to continue writing software, creating a blog to put my writing, poetry, and compositions onto, contacting employers and finding a <em>correct fit</em> of a job, and <em>trying</em> to keep healthy with food stamps that <em>my tax money</em> paid for with the $16.5+ hourly salary I <em>earned</em> over the last few years.</p>

<p>...and I&#39;m criticized for having a bottle of alcohol. </p>

<p>If you are having struggles and feeling upset, I completely understand that and empathize for you. If you <em>really</em> feel against me being in this household, then kick me out. I will live on the street and try to find a job, as a tried to do in my car when my attempt at an <em>honest</em> relationship forced me to do it.</p>

<p>I have tried for 26 years. This wanna-be democracy, shameful and pitiful attempt at living a Christian, godly lifestyle, running a country in that fashion, and calling it patriotic is the biggest form of retardation and stupidity I&#39;ve ever seen. This is why I don&#39;t believe in God. All of you have successfully convinced me that it is a wrong thing to do.</p>

<p>I can have respect. I really can, but I&#39;ve been stretched too far. I encourage you to find a reason why I should not end this waste of a life in an attempt to meet <em>your</em> god.</p>

<p>-Jon</p>
