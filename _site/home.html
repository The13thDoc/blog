	<h1>Blog</h1>

	<p>The Doc's repository of thoughts and things, and things from
		thoughts. Renegade photons of arbitrary memories and recollections
		resounding between, among, and around axons and neurons....only to
		land here.</p>
	<p>Enjoy.</p>

			<h2>A Harsh Start</h2>
			<p>Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr...so many places to spew fourth
				one's stupidity and indulge one's narcissism.</p>


			<p>In a time when things are so customizable, they are, still, so
				restricting. I begin this as many developers, old-school engineers,
				and anyone else utilizing HTML for communication do, creating my own
				space to say, "Hello, World." and doing it from scratch...f rom
				code, anyway.
			<p>I began this harshly, with a vague plan as to how to construct
				a Blog appropriately. I'm not especially proud of that, but it's a
				work in progress from this point on. Caffeine, stress, and the need
				to focus thoughts on something more productive. Heh.</p>

			<h1>About Jonny</h1>
			</p>
			<p>I'm Jon. I like to write. Sometimes I write code, sometimes
				music, sometimes lyrics. Other times, I simply jot down insane and
				incoherent thoughts. This is where I spew thoughts of advice,
				wisdom, rage, and/or insanity. Read some. They may be
				inspirational....or encourage thoughts of homicide and a disgust
				towards humanity.</p>
