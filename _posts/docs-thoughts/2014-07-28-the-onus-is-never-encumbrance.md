I found someone. A wonderful one.  
Quite the one. We have such fun.  
One to one; vice-versal sum.  
Two to some. Eleven to none.  

Quirky, daffy, a splendid one.  
I got this one. I did. I did.  
No buying this one, not one quid.  

Have I won? In some ways have.  
No game was played, but fun was had.  
Has she won? In some ways has.  
Same non-game; same non-fad.  

I like this one. I truly do.  
I’ve liked others, but far a few.  

This is one, one Far off,  
And one so Few, that’s how I knew.  

Between the Occipital and the Frontal,  
the sheets, the arms, and not-so-subtle.  

Grip this one and clutch, I must.  
Learn, develop, build the trust.  
React, respond, enjoy the lust,  
with one such kept, till Death due dust.
