Being here, residing in solidarity,  
free from you all, away from you all,  
I will be both redeemed, and chastised from you all.  

Because I, am the bitter, and the blessing, lingering amongst you all.  
You are the tripe which you spew forth,  
from the sewage of your bowels, and the depths of your cowardice.  
You, are the tripe, the trivial, and the inexplicably transcendent.  

Together, we are the perpetual causality of our own, mutually sustained destruction and survival.
