title: Had to See About a Girl

Recently, I “had to see about a girl”. She was great from across the room, shoulder to shoulder, knee to knee, word from mouth, word to ear. Everything was great. One could probably see the sparks from across the room. A lot was said. A lot was discussed. A lot was mutual. I didn't take her home. I didn't want to, not that night. She’s worth more. Hell, I’m worth more.

I had a show I wanted to catch that night. I asked for her number. She played hard to get. I laughed...then played along. I didn’t catch the show. I didn't need to. “had to see about a girl”. I knew what was important. The night went on. More sparks flew.

I went home that night. Other than the amount of substances I consumed, I had no regrets and made no mistakes that night. She said we’d see each other again. So, I waited.

Eventually, I saw her again, as she said. It was good. I’m glad I saw her. More things were discussed. More things were learned. She is taken. I was a fool to not see that in the first place, as gorgeous as she is. So, alright, surprised, but not unexpected. I dealt with it. I wasn’t upset or angry. I had fun with her and her friends. The night ended. I returned a favor she had given the first night we met. I went home.

The next step: telling her that I’m going to step back and let her workout her current relationship. She needs to do what’s best for her. I don’t want to rush. I don’t want to strip her from someone. I don’t want to turn her into someone that neither of us wants her to be. I want something long term, something honest, something sincere, something lasting, something loving, something that’s not a one-night stand. I know that. I’ve always known that. I know damn well what I want. She needed to know that. I don’t know what this will mean for me, and that hurts.

I may never be with her. I may never see her again. I don’t know what choices she will make. It’s a pain I’m willing to embrace because she deserves it. Hell, I deserve it. We both deserve something great. I hope we both can find it and hang on to it, if we haven’t yet.

Until then, here’s to that girl.
