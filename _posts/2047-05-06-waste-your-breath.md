Oh so simply undeserving. Oh so simply disconcerting.
Oh so wickedly complementing. Try your best not to forgive me.

Kindness, empathy, and the like. Oh so tender and contrite.
Who would’ve known the other side breeds life to something so un-right.

Tortion, breakage, mutilation. Where the fuck is my salvation?!
My state of mind, it ruptures slowly. In time you’ll regret having ever known me. Forfeit your sanity to cope with mine. Walk with me down that thin, fine line.

Exhale. Inhale. Hyperventilation. Don’t pass out. The air is growing thin.

We’re gonna freak out, but not quite yet. First we’re gonna push it more.
Push the limits. Push them down. Push them down, and then we’ll soar.

There’s no stopping, pausing, breaking. What fun is that? I want exhilarating!
Then when you crash, hit the cold, cold, hard, dying center of your world,
you’ll feel remorse sinking in and seeping out through bleeding skin.

Exhale. Inhale. Suffocation. Don’t pass out. The air is growing thin.

We’re gonna freak out the lungs inside, collapsing with every puff and cry.
Time was not on our side. Maybe in another life.
Exhale. Inhale. A few more times. Suck the air out of the skies.
Fight for life so pathetically. Where this leads, we’ll never see.

Exhale. Inhale. One more try.
Exhale. Inhale. One more time.

Exhale. Inhale. One more try.
Exhale. Inhale. Still alive.

Exhale. Inhale. One more try.
Exhale. Inhale. One more time.

Exhale. Inhale. One more try.
Exhale. Inhale. Hold your breath...
